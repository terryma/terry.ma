I'm trying to test embedding videos on this new blog and thought of this fascinating Ted talk I watched a while ago. If you haven't seen it, well, see it now:

Here's the [picture](http://s3.amazonaws.com/ciclops_ir_2006/2230_6163_1.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=14V1KFXK26R9EA1V0Q02&amp;Expires=1276715036&amp;Signature=yHiXMPlvM%2Bmt81JMrYiElwOGO2E%3D) at the end of the video (taken from [CICLOPS)](http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=2230), can you spot us?</p>
