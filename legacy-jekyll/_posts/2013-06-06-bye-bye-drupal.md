title: Bye Drupal, hi Jekyll
tags: [jekyll]

I hosted my old, seldomly updated blog on my home server using Drupal for the last few years. Drupal has gotten to be too complicated for my purposes - I just need a very simple system that supports text. I've been writing markdown a lot lately and have heard much goodness about Jekyll. I am now a much happier man.
