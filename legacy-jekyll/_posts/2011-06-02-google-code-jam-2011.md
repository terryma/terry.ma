title: Google Code Jam 2011
---
Round 2 of [Google Code Jam](http://code.google.com/codejam/) 2011 is this Saturday. My goal this time around is to get a t-shirt, which means I need to be in the top 1000 out of the 3000 people that advanced to Round 2. Last year I was close, but no cigar. Hopefully this year I&#39;ll be able to squeeze it in.

My participation so far: [http://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/name/tma](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/name/tma)

[update: I didn&#39;t make it :( It was a good experience nonetheless, time to toughen up and get prepared for next year I guess...]
