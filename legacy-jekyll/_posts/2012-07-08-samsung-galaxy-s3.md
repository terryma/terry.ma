title: Samsung Galaxy S3
---
I finally replaced my 2 year old [Samsung Epic 4G](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SPH-D700ZKASPR)&nbsp;with the just released [Samsung Galaxy S3](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SPH-L710RWBSPR). I&#39;ve only had it for a day so far, and all I can say is, what an absolutely amazing phone it is. I remember how much I loved my Epic 4G when I first got it, thinking it was blazing fast and gorgeous and extremely powerful. Yet when I put the S3 next to it is when the bulky piece of metal seems like an uncivilized caveman from the distant past. It pales in comparison in every single regard I can compare the two devices. The S3 has faster processor, more RAM, more internal storage, better cameras, larger screen, less weight, and better battery. It&#39;s not better by just a little either, the upgrade is huge in every category. The only feature one might argue is better on the Epic 4G is the hardware keyboard, which I personally really liked. But I think the S3 more than make up for the lack of it with the much larger screen which makes it much easier to type with the soft keys.&nbsp;

Here&#39;s what my current homescreen look like after tweaking it for a few hours:
