title: Movie marathon
---

Went on a 8 movie marathon this weekend. Excessive, yes, but disciplinary issues is a topic for another day. Just a short sentence about each movie with my afterthought, for the purpose of helping myself remember.

1.  [力王](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102293/) (Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky) - Loved it.&nbsp; So outrageous, so gory, so much fun.
2.  [人在囧途](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1737237/) (Lost on Journey) - Loved it just as much if not more. There were countless laugh out loud moments and I was really able to make a deep connection with the main character. Very much of a feel-good, heart warming film where by the end of it, I felt loved and was grateful of the society that I live in.
3.  [僵尸先生](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089371/) (Mr. Stiff Corpse) - Oldest movie in the bunch, and still loads of fun. Brings back fond memories of all the silly and goofy Hong Kong comedies in the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s.
4.  [The Bucket List](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/) - I just didn&#39;t feel &#39;it&#39;, it being this natural connection I feel when watching a movie I ended up loving. This one didn&#39;t work for me.
5.  [Grown Up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375670/)s - This is what I&#39;d like to call a &quot;cinematic masturbation&quot; - enjoyable while at it, but quickly forgettable afterwards, and probably bad for you if done too many times.
6.  [Hachi: A Dog&#39;s tale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028532/) - One word: Beautiful
7.  [Gran Torino](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/) - This was an emotional coaster ride. Hachi already built up some of the sadness within me to be unleashed, and by the end of this, I was crying a river. The amout of connection I was able to make with the characters is incredible, I was literally able to predict some exact dialogs because I was subconsciously put in their shoes. This is what makes this film so powerful.
8.  [Mystic River](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327056/) - After Gran Torino, my appreciation for Clint Eastwood&#39;s directing just went up another notch. I still haven&#39;t seen Mystic River so this was a no brainer. Let&#39;s just say that I ended the marathon with the perfect movie - so much food for thought I&#39;m still stuffed the day after. And the acting, just wow.

If I have to rate based on how much I loved each, here&#39;re my gut feels:

1.  Gran Torino
2.  Mystic River
3.  人在囧途
4.  力王
5.  Hachi: A Dog&#39;s tale
6.  僵尸先生
7.  The Bucket List
8.  Grown Ups
