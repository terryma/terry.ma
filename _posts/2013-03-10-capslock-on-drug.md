This was a HUGE revelation.

Instead of a useless key that I never use but incredibly easy to reach, I now use it all the time.

Hitting capslock once generates escape, this makes Vim extremely pleasant.

Holding capslock generates Hyper (Ctrl+Shift+Option+Cmd), and I've mapped it with other keys to do a bunch of useful things. I'll write about my dev setup in a future post.

Huge success.
