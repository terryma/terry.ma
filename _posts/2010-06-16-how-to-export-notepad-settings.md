title: How to "export" Notepad++ settings
---

I had trouble finding out how to export all my settings for [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and I was too lazy to find out which files the app touches for saving the various different settings (style, keyboard shortcut, etc). I ended up installing the [portable](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable) version to my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) folder, so far everything has worked out perfectly.
