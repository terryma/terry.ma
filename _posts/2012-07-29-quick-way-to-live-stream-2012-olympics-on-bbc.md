title: Quick way to live stream 2012 Olympics on BBC
---
It&#39;s 2012, but streaming the Olympics live still isn&#39;t as simple as a few clicks away for people that live in the US. NBC does provide a live stream if you have cable subscription, but as someone who rarely ever watches TV, having cable is silly. BBC streams the entire event for free, but only to people who live in the UK. There&#39;s a long [thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4306600)&nbsp;on hackernews filled with people having the same set of issues. One simple, free solution that easily worked for me is using [tunlr](http://tunlr.net/status/).

Simples steps to follow on Windows:

*   Download [DNS jumper](http://www.sordum.net/?p=4573). This makes it painless to switch your primary and secondary DNS servers
*   Add tunlr&#39;s DNS (64.250.122.104 and&nbsp;199.167.30.144) to DNS jumper and click &quot;Apply Dns&quot;
*   Go to&nbsp;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video)&nbsp;and enjoy!
*   Remember to switch back to your default DNS using DNS jumper afterwards
*   Go thank the guys behind tunlr. :)
