I like building things. I'm a UT Austin graduate, live in the Pacific Northwest, and currently work at
Convoy. Previously I worked at Arivale, Google, and Amazon. I've been making software
professionally for over a decade, and when I get a break from that, I enjoy rock climbing, tennis, movies, board games,
and lots of sleep.
