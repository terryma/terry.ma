<p>
  I like building things. I'm a UT Austin graduate, live in the Pacific Northwest, and currently working on my own
  <a href='https://wealthly.com'>startup</a>. Previously I worked at Convoy, Arivale, Google, and Amazon. I've been making software professionally for over
  a decade, and when I get a break from that, I enjoy investing, rock climbing,
  tennis, movies, board games, escape rooms, and as much
  sleep as I can get.
